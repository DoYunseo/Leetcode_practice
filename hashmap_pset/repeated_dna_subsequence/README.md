# 187. Repeated DNA Subsequences

The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`.

- For example, `"ACAAGGGGTA"` is a **DNA Sequence**

When studying **DNA**  it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence** return all the `10-letter` long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in the DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.
