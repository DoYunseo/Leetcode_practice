# 3024. Type of Triangle

You are given a **0-indexed integer** array `nums` of size `3` which can form the sides of a triangle.

A triangle is called **equilateral** if it has all sides of equal length.
A triangle is called **isosceles** if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
A triangle is called **scalene** if all its sides are of different lengths.

Return a _string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or `"none"` if it **cannot** form a triangle_.
