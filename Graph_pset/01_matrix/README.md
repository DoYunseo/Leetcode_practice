# 542. 01 Matrix

Given an `m x n` binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is 1.

# Savio's complexity analysis

- Time complexity: `O(V + 2E)`
- Space complexity: `O(N * M)` where `N` is the row length and `M` is col length
