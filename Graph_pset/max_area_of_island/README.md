# 695. Max Area Of Island

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

_Return the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.
