1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

## Yunseo's Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n) - where n is length of string 's'
- Space complexity: O(1) - uses constant space for list 'first' and 'last'
