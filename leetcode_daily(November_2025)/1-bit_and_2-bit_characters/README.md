717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

We have two special characters:

The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

## Yunseo's Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(n) - where n is the length of the list
- Space complexity: O(1) - only uses additional constant space 'i'

# Savio's Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
- Space complexity: `O(n)`
