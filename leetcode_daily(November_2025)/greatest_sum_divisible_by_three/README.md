1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three

Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.

# Yunseo's complexity analysis
- Time complexity: O(n): where n is the length of list 'nums'
- Space complexity: O(1): use additional space for list 'dp'
