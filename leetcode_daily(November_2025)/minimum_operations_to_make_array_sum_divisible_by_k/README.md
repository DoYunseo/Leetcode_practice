3512. Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.

# Yunseo's complexity analysis
- Time complexity: O(n) because the while loop iterates n times in the worst case
- Space complexity: O(1) only uses constant space variables
