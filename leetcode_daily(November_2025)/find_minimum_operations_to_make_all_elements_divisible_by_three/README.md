3190. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three

You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.

Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.

## Yunseo's complexity analysis

- Time complexity: O(n) - where n is the length of the list 'nums'
- Space complexity: O(1) - for additional variable 'cnt'

## Savio's Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
