# 1557. Minimum Number Vertices to Reach All Nodes

Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.


# Yunseo's complexity analysis
Time complexity: O(E + N) – iterating through all edges and checking all nodes.
Space complexity: O(N) – for storing destination nodes in a set and the answer list.
