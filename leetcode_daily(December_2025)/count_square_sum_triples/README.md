1925. Count Square Sum Triples

A square triple (a,b,c) is a triple where a, b, and c are integers and a2 + b2 = c2.

Given an integer n, return the number of square triples such that 1 <= a, b, c <= n.

# Yunseo's Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(n^2) - nested for loop which has range of n
Space complexity: O(1) - only uses constant space for variable "cnt"
