961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array

You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:

nums.length == 2 * n.
nums contains n + 1 unique elements.
Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.
Return the element that is repeated n times.

# Yunseo's Time complexity analysis
- Time complexity: O(n): iteration loop runs through n times in the worst case
- Space complexity: O(n): uniques list needs additional space lenght n in the worst case
