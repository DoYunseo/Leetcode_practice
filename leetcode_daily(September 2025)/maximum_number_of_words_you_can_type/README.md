# 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

# Yunseo's complexity analysis
Time complexity: O(N * M) - where n is the length of text including " ", and m is the length of brokenLetters
Space complexity: O(1) - only use constant space
