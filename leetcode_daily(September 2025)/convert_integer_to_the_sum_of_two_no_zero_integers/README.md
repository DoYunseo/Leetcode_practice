1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

# Yunseo's complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(n) - where n is the number given in the testcases
Space complexity: O(1) - doesn't use any additional space

# Savio's complexity analysis

- Time complexity: `O(n)` - where `n` is the max possible number of pairs we could get.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`
