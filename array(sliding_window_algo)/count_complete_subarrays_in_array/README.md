# 2799. Count Complete Subarrays in an Array

You are given an array nums consisting of **positive** integers.

We call a subarray of an array **complete** if the following
condition is satisfied:

The number of **distinct** elements in the subarray is
equal to the number of distinct elements in the
whole array.

Return the number of \*_complete_ _subarrays_.

A **subarray** is a contiquous non-empty part of an array.
