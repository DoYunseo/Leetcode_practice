You are given an integer `n`

We need to group the numbers from `1` to `n` according to the sum of its digits. For example, the numbers 14 and 5 belong to the same group whereas 13 and 3 belong to different groups.

Return the number of groups that have the largest size i.e the maximum number of elements.
